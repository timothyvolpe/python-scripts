# Python Script Collection
A collection of small Python scripts I've written

## Script Descriptions
### pb-scrape.py
Scrapes peak lists from peakbagger.com and stores select info in a csv file

### distillog/distillog_temp.py
Reads temperature data from an Arduino connected to temp sensors, and graphs it using matplotlib. Plans exist to add more graphs and data types such as pressure.
